You must have a side folder named jack with the complete source of the jack-audio-connections-kit, to compile this.
so for example:
/Users/xxx/Desktop/jackcoreaudio-.../
/Users/xxx/Desktop/jack/

!!!VERY IMPORTANT!!!:
You must use jack 0.82 to compile and use this.

example:
/usr/local/bin/./jackd -R -d coreaudio -r 44100 -p 512 -ci 2 -co 2 -n "Built-in Audio"
