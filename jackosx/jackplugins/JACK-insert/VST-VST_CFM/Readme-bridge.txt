DESCRIPTION:VST Mach-O Bridge allows you to create VST Mac OS X plug-ins usingMach-O development toolchain (Project Builder, etc.)With these development tools it is very easy to use low-levelMac OS X APIs such as POSIX threads or BSD sockets in your plug-ins.DISCUSSION:Mac OS X VST plug-ins are implemented as PowerPC code resourcesin CFM PEF object format. Apple's Project Builder developmentenvironment cannot create objects in this format (at least not inthe standard distribution.)VST Mach-O Bridge removes this limitation by providing a "bridge"that loads a plug-in in Mach-O object format and translates callsfrom CFM binary interface to Mach-O binary interface and vice versa.The "bridge" operations are totally transparent to the host applicationand plug-in code.TECHNICAL DETAILS:Completed plug-in using VST Mach-O Bridge is assembled from 2 pieces -1. Bridge code resource of type 'aEff' (source code included)This part is implemented as ordinary VST plug-in withthe only difference - it does nothing but loads the real plug-in codeand translates host-to-plugin and plugin-to-host calls.It is stored as the resource of type 'aEff' in the resource fork ofresulting plug-in file.2. Plug-in in Mach-O object format of type 'MH_BUNDLE'This part is created using Mach-O development toolchain (Project Builder, etc.)and is put as data fork into resulting plug-in file.Also, plug-in file should have file type 'aPcs' to be recognized by host applicationas a file containing VST plug-in code.HOWTO:Here are the step-by-step instructions for creation of such plug-in with Project Builder.(you should already know how to create CFM VST plug-ins)1. Start with Project Builder template project "Bundle".2. Add source files to the project.3. Add "vst_macho_bridge.r" file containing the bridge code to your projectand set "Put Mac OS resources: in Resource fork of the executable" option in the"Linker Settings" section of the "Build Settings" pane.4. Change resource name of the bridge resource to the name of your plug-in(default name is "VST Mach-O Bridge")5. Rename your plug-in's main function to "vst_main"Note: if your code is C++, declare it as extern "C" function like this:extern "C" { AEffect *vst_main(audioMasterCallback audioMaster); }6. Compile and link plug-in's code, you will find the plug-in file in"YourBundleName.bundle/Contents/MacOS/" directory, named (no surprises) "YourBundleName".7. Set file type of plug-in file to 'aPcs'.Congratulations! now you have VST Plug-in compiled with Project Builder.KNOWN BUG/ISSUES:Since there's no VSTGUI library in Mach-O object format (as far as I know)you cannot use it in Mach-O plug-ins.-------------------------VST Mach-O BridgeCopyright (c) 2002 Alex Lagutin.<alex@subband.com>VST is a trademark of Steinberg Soft- und Hardware GmbH.VST PlugIn Interface Technology by Steinberg Soft- und Hardware GmbH.
